# entanglement
中文：《纠缠》是由zxcwsdd开发的游戏，主体使用unity引擎开发，游戏主体发生在一个量子世界，两个量子球之间同时做三维方向相反，速度相同的运动。
游戏灵感：来自作者高中看潘建伟教授的科普，大三时有了游戏的大体思路，打算做成3d游戏，玩家操作两个Q版小球分别到达终点，以两个量子球运动方式为主要特色，以弹跳为补充特色，弹跳会加入二段跳，撑杆跳以及超级跳等跳跃方式，同时场内道具丰富，提供多样的通关方式。
English: “Entanglement” is a game developed by zxcwsdd, utilizing the Unity engine. The game takes place in a quantum world, where two quantum balls move simultaneously in opposite three-dimensional directions at the same speed.
Inspiration for the game ：came from the author’s high school studies on Professor Pan Jianwei’s popular science, which formed the initial concept during their third year of college. The plan was to create a 3D game where players control two Q-style balls to reach the finish line. The main feature of the game revolves around the movement of the two quantum balls, while bouncing is a supplementary feature. Bouncing includes double jumps, pole vault jumps, and super jumps, providing various ways to complete levels. The game also includes a variety of in-game items, offering different ways to overcome challenges.
